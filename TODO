Shaders and effects!
Add some twists for every correct guess?

Make a main menu to cycle through gamemodes (normal and rougelike)

Ideas for rougelike elements:
-Create shop and points.
-Funky items in the shop
-Create a switch button for a more correct guess with x2 points or nothing
-Player has some health?
--When close to death, foce to play 50:50
---Special event on getting 50 exactly
-Structured gameloop with challenges and/or bosses
-Maybe remember pairs of [currentNumber] and [correctNumbers] and then create some kind of a minigame with them

Less rng in gameplay?
(surely no...)
